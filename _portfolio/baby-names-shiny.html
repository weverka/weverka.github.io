As someone who's a bit of a namenerd I've always liked seeing how names have increased and retreated in popularity over time and 
thinking about how that reflects social trends. When I was deciding on a name for a child of my own I wanted a tool that would
let me visualize how potential candidates fared over time, as well as relative to one another. I also wanted something where I
could quickly see how similar variations (i.e., Sofia, Sophia, Sophie etc.) were trending. These data seemed like the perfect
opportunity to get more familar with the R package Shiny, which allows for easy user interaction without having to spin up a 
server or bog down a client-side browser.
