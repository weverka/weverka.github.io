As a new mom who recently relocated to Sacramento, I was on the hunt for a daycare provider for my daughter. Most of the websites
that had this informaiton required you to search by zip code and as a transplant to the area, who was also unsure where she'd ultimately
end up working, I wanted to visualize the data in a more nuanced way. I therefore downloaded the full list of licensed
childcare providers from the CA Department of Social Services, geocoded their addresses and created a web map using Leaflet.js.
